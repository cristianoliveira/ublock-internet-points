# ublock-internet-points

An ublock filter list to hide most of the internet points for your own mental health <3

So I can still enjoy those platforms without getting affected by those internet points, in neither a positive or negative way. :)

## Installation

Add the following URL to your adblocker:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cristianoliveira/ublock-fake-internet-points/main/ublock-filter.txt
```

I use [ublock origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) so I can't guarantee it will work on other adblockers.
